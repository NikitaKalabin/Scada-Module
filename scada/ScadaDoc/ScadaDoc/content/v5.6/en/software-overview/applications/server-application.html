    </p>
    <p>Server consists of a Windows service and a graphical shell. The shell is shown in Figure 1. The service does not have user interface. It operates continuously in the background regardless of user login and logout.</p>
    <p>The application monitors user connections and checks user rights while processing requests and passing commands. Information about the application state and performed actions is stored in text log files. Server is designed for non-stop running.</p>
    <p>Additional server modules allow extending the functionality of Server according to customer requirements.</p>
