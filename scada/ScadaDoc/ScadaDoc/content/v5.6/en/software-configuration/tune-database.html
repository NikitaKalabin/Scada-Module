    <h1>Tune up Configuration Database</h1>

    <p>The configuration database is a structured description of the entire automated system. The application included in Rapid SCADA use the information from the configuration database in conjunction with their settings.</p>

    <p>The configuration database is edited using the Administrator application. The edited instance of the configuration database is in SDF file format of Microsoft SQL Server Compact Edition. After completing the necessary changes an administrator clicks <img src="../../common-images/pass.gif" /> button to convert the database in a specially designed DAT format which is used by the other applications. Such approach allows modifying the configuration database while the software is running.</p>

    <p>The configuration database consists of tables, which in turn are composed of columns and rows. Each table belongs to one of the following groups:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><em>System.</em> This group contains the tables which define a configuration of a particular automated system.</li>
        <li><em>Dictionaries</em>. This group contains the auxiliary tables. In most cases changing of these tables is not needed and can cause incorrect operation of the software.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The following table describes the configuration database tables.</p>

    <table class="sd-article-table">
        <tr>
            <th>Table Name</th>

    <p>The following list is a sequence of working with the configuration database in the Administrator application:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Create a backup copy of the existing database by pressing <img src="../../common-images/backup.gif" /> button. In addition, the Administrator application automatically saves a copy of the database before passing it to Server.</li>
        <li>If the sample data are not needed, clear the tables of the <em>System</em> group. According to relations between the tables, start clearing from the <em>Rights</em> table and continue till the <em>Objects</em> table. <em>Do not</em> delete rows with identifiers from 0 to 4 of the <em>Roles</em> table.</li>
        <li>Enter data in the tables of the <em>System</em> group. Use the opposite order starting from the <em>Objects</em> table and finishing by <em>Rights</em> table. There are <em>Create channels</em> and <em>Clone channels</em> features designed for fast automatic filling the <em>Input channels</em> and <em>Output channels</em> tables.</li>
        <li>Pass the configuration database to Server using <img src="../../common-images/pass.gif" /> button.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>It is possible to significantly speed up a process of system configuration by using the past works. The <em>Export</em> and <em>Import</em> features allow exchanging data between different databases. These features are accessible in <em>Database</em> menu. Data tables are exported to DAT format files, then the information can be imported from these files into the same or another configuration database. A range of exported and imported data can be restricted by specifying the start and the final identifiers (see Figure 1). In addition, if a new start identifier is specified, identifiers of the imported data are shifted.</p>

    </p>

    <p>The <em>Create channels</em> feature (see Figure 2), which is accessible in <em>Service</em> menu, allows automatic filling the <em>Input channels</em> and <em>Output channels</em> tables using information about existing objects and devices. Rules for creating channels are defined in device libraries (drivers) of Communicator. The device libraries are located in C:\SCADA\ScadaComm\KP\ by default. If a DLL file, specified in the <em>Device types</em> table, does not exist, the creation of channels corresponding to that device type is impossible. Channels are created according to the settings of Communicator.</p>

    <p>To create input and output channels, tick the appropriate devices, choose or keep undefined the object for the each device, click the <em>Calculate channel numbers</em> button, check the calculated numbers, then click the <em>Create</em> button.</p>

    </p>

    <p>The <em>Clone channels</em> feature (see Figure 3) is also designed to make the process of creating input and output channels faster. The objects and the devices of the cloned channels can be replaced by the specified values during cloning.</p>

    </p>

    <p>Editing of input channels may be done either directly in a table or by using the form that is shown in Figure 4. Right click an input channel row to show popup menu and click the menu item to open this form.</p>

    <p>The <em>Compact database</em> feature decreases the size of the configuration database file. Use this feature when the database editing has been completed. To execute the feature click the <em>Database &gt; Compact</em> main menu item.</p>
