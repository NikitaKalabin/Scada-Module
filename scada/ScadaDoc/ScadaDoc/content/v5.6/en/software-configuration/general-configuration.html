    <h1>General Configuration Sequence</h1>
    <p>Starting to work with Rapid SCADA, it is recommended to follow the general configuration sequence described below. Having obtained some working experience, better understanding the dependencies between the applications, the sequence can be varied for improving efficiency.</p>
