How to Build Rapid SCADA
------------------------
Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 is needed. Visual Studio Community is OK.

1. Download the source code from SCADA and DLL repositories:
   https://github.com/RapidScada/scada
   https://github.com/RapidScada/dll

2. Build the solutions using Visual Studio in the following sequence:
   Log,
   Report,
   ScadaData,
   ScadaAgent,
   ScadaComm,
   OpenKPs,
   ScadaServer,
   OpenModules,
   ScadaWeb,
   OpenPlugins,
   ScadaScheme,
   ScadaTable,
   ScadaAdmin5.

   Switch to the Release configuration so that the references are correct.

3. Enjoy the binaries built by yourself.
